<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Sprinkler Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire protection sprinkler systems are generally classified into two main types: active and passive systems. Active systems, such as wet and dry sprinklers, actively engage during a fire to suppress flames and reduce heat by discharging water. In contrast, passive systems, including fire-resistant walls and ceilings, do not actively extinguish fires but rather contain and slow their spread, providing occupants more time to evacuate. Both types are crucial for comprehensive fire safety in various environments.</p></p>
