<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Substitutes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autotrans plantation</li><li>Allograft</li><li>Xenotrans plantation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone substitutes market comprises three primary types: autografts, allografts, and xenografts. Autografts involve using the patientâ€™s own bone tissue, minimizing rejection risk and enhancing integration but may require a second surgical site. Allografts utilize bone tissue from donors, offering a larger supply without additional surgery but carrying a slight risk of disease transmission. Xenografts are derived from animal sources, providing a biocompatible option that can stimulate bone growth, yet they may pose immunological challenges. Together, they address diverse orthopedic and dental needs.</p></p>
