<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformer Oil Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Axial Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The transformer oil pumps market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal and axial flow pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize a rotating impeller to move the oil, providing high flow rates and efficient operation, often used in large transformer applications. In contrast, axial flow pumps move oil along the pump axis, offering advantages in handling higher flow rates at lower pressure, making them suitable for cooling applications in transformers. Both types are essential for ensuring optimal performance and reliability in transformer cooling systems.</p></p>
