<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parking Lot Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fan</li><li>Jet Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The parking lot ventilation system market primarily comprises two main types: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans are designed to move air parallel to the fan's axis, providing effective ventilation across larger spaces, ideal for typical parking lots. Jet fans, on the other hand, utilize high-velocity airflow to direct air and exhaust pollutants efficiently, often used in enclosed spaces or areas with specific airflow requirements. Both types ensure safety and comfort by maintaining air quality in parking environments.</p></p>
