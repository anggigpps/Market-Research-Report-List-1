<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step Index</li><li>Gradient Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multimode fiber optic cables market primarily consists of two types: step index and gradient index. Step index cables feature a uniform core refractive index, leading to distinct light refraction at the core-cladding interface, suitable for short-distance communication. In contrast, gradient index cables have a gradually varying refractive index, which minimizes modal dispersion and allows for higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances. Both types are essential for applications in data centers, telecommunications, and industrial networking, catering to diverse connectivity needs.</p></p>
